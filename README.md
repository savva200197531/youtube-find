# youtube-find

## important!!!
### before proceeding with the installation of dependencies, create a .env.local file in root directory of project and write the line VUE_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY = [YOUR_API_KEY] where [YOUR_API_KEY] is your key from the YouTube api without square brackets, it is not desirable to disclose the key from the api, so I decided to remove it from the source code.
